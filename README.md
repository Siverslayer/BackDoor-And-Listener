# Backdoor and Listener

The Backdoor and Listener project is a tool designed for creating and managing backdoor access to a target system, along with a listener component to intercept and control the communication with the backdoor.

## Introduction

Backdoors are a type of malicious software that allows unauthorized access to a computer system. The Backdoor and Listener tool simplifies the process of deploying and managing such backdoors, providing an easy-to-use interface for controlling remote access to target systems.

## Features

- **Backdoor Creation:** Easily generate backdoor executables for various operating systems.
- **Listener:** Set up a listener to intercept connections from backdoors and control remote access.
- **Stealth Mode:** Hide the presence of the backdoor on the target system to avoid detection.
- **Command Execution:** Execute commands on the target system through the backdoor connection.
- **File Transfer:** Transfer files between the attacker and target systems.

## Usage

1. **Backdoor Generation:** Use the provided tool to generate a backdoor executable tailored to your target's operating system.
2. **Listener Setup:** Configure the listener to listen for connections from the generated backdoor.
3. **Deploy Backdoor:** Transfer and execute the generated backdoor on the target system.
4. **Control Access:** Once a connection is established, use the listener interface to interact with the backdoor and execute commands on the target system.

## Warning

This tool is intended for educational and research purposes only. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical. Use this tool responsibly and only on systems you are authorized to access.
